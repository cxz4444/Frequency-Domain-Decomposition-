# Frequency-Domain-Decomposition-
For a three-degree-of-freedom system, assuming that it is subjected to independent white noise random excitation, the acceleration data file sampling frequency is 100HZ, combined with the frequency-domain decomposition method to find the modal frequencies and vibration shapes of this structure
